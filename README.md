# Data_Cleaning_in_MySQL_Full_Project

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset using SQL queries. The dataset contains data that needs to be transformed, missing values handled, and irrelevant entries filtered to make it suitable for further analysis or modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset is located in the `dataset/` folder. It is provided in CSV format (`data.csv`) and contains various records that need to be cleaned.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries used for data cleaning are located in the `queries/` folder:
- **`clean_data_queries.sql`**: This file contains SQL queries to:
  - Handle missing or invalid values.
  - Filter irrelevant or outlier data.
  - Perform data transformations for consistency.

## How to Use
1. Import the `data.csv` into your SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Execute the queries from the `clean_data_queries.sql` file to clean the data.
3. Use the cleaned dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## Requirements
- SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)
